      Changing the Ruby version on macOS depends on how it was installed. First, find how it was installed (see <a href="https://mac.install.guide/faq/check-ruby-version/index.html">Check Ruby version on Mac</a>). Is it the pre-installed Mac system Ruby? Was it installed with Homebrew or a version manager? Don't try to change the <a href="https://mac.install.guide/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html">"system" Ruby</a> as it is there for macOS, not you. It's best to install a software version manager if you plan to switch among Ruby versions. Each version manager has a command to list and set Ruby versions. See the article <a href="https://mac.install.guide/faq/change-ruby-version/index.html">Change Ruby version Mac</a>.
