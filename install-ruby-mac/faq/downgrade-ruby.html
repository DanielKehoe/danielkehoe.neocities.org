      Downgrading the Ruby version on macOS depends on how you installed Ruby. Did you use Homebrew or a version manager like asdf chruby, rbenv, or rvm? See <a href="https://mac.install.guide/faq/check-ruby-version/index.html">Check Ruby version on Mac</a> to check. If you're using the <a href="https://mac.install.guide/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html">"system" Ruby</a> don't uninstall it as it is there for macOS, not you. If you installed Ruby with Homebrew, it's best to install a software version manager so you can switch among Ruby versions. Asdf is good for managing multiple languages. <a href="/ruby/6.html">Install Ruby with asdf</a> if you are developing Rails web applications (which require Ruby, Node, and Yarn) or if you are using multiple languages such as Ruby, Node, and Python. <a href="/ruby/12.html">Install Ruby with chruby</a>, rbenv, or rvm if you need to manage only Ruby versions (chruby is simpler than rbenv or rvm). If you installed Ruby with a version manager, you can switch among versions. See <a href="https://mac.install.guide/faq/downgrade-ruby/index.html">Downgrade Ruby on Mac</a> for details.
